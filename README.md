**Note: Do not attempt to use this directly unless you
know what you are doing. The happy path is to let `roadie` interact with this
template for you.**

This is a template repository. It will be used by `roadie` to instantiate
instances. We will make an initial commit on those repos with this boilerplate,
so there is traceability as to the version of this template the repo was created
with. This could be useful in figuring out later upgrades necessary to keep
a repo up-to-date with compliance standards.
