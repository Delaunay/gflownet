# These are the minimum specifications required to set up a development
# environment and includes things like  depedencies required for testing, tools
# for ensuring security, formatting, and static checking compliance. Feel free
# to add anything that improves your developer experience.
#
# Do you like to test things in a notebook? Then, add `notebook` here. Do you
# find yourself inspecting objects a lot in the REPL? May I suggest `pdir2`. Do
# you like lots of colors and formatting options in your REPL, then get `rich`.
# Remember, it doesn't pay to be too specific here, roadie can be used to
# resolve your environment and make it reproducible for others.
